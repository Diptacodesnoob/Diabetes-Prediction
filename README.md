# Naive Bayes Tutorial

## Overview
This project is a tutorial on the Naive Bayes classification algorithm, demonstrating its application with real-world datasets. The tutorial covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The tutorial uses a dataset that includes features such as:
-Pregnancies	
-Glucose	
-BMI	
-DiabetesPedigreeFunction	
-Age 
-Outcome(Target Variable)

## Installation
To run this tutorial, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, use Jupyter Notebook to execute the `.ipynb` file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-tutorial.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd naive-bayes-tutorial
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook naive-bayes-tutorial-2.ipynb
```
4. Run the cells to understand Naive Bayes classification step by step.

## Model
The Naive Bayes classifier is explained and applied to classification problems. The tutorial covers different types of Naive Bayes models, including:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes

## Results
The tutorial provides accuracy metrics and visualizations to demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in different scenarios.
